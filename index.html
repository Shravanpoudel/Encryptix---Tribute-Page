        2015) was an Indian aerospace scientist who served as the 11th
        president of India from 2002 to 2007. He was born and raised in
        Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace
        engineering. He spent the next four decades as a scientist and
        science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and
        Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research
        Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's civilian
        space programme and military missile development efforts.[1] He thus
        came to be known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the
        development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle
        technology.[2][3][4] He also played a pivotal organisational,
